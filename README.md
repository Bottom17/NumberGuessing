# NumberGuessing
Number guessing game.

Negative numbers are not allowed. You choose the range of the numbers, per example, "0 10" which means the range goes from 0 included to 10 included.
Every time you don't get it right the program prints out wether the number guessed was above or below the number.		     

Have fun!!
